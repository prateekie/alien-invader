 Repo for AlienInvader Java GUI Game


Hello! This was a Java GUI Project authored by Prateek Kaushik. 

He wrote it to practice what he was learning, specifically focusing on GUI, Inheritance, and projects with many moving parts. 

This game is a clone of the immensely popular Space Invaders game from 1978 with a few quirks. You can read more about the original game here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders 


Game Play:
Move your ship in any direction by dragging your mouse. Shoot missiles at aliens by clicking the spacebar. You can earn more points by killing more aliens. The aliens come in many shapes and sizes, and some of them can become invisible too. If you are shot by alien's missiles, the game will end. Please note, that this feature has been documented not to work when using newer versions of Java, and when not run in Eclipse. Prateek is still trying to figure out what could be causing this, and will update the game accordingly if there is a fix.
